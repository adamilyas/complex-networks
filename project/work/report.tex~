\section{Basic implementation}

a) If Allentown (node-id=0) is infected at the beginning of the data set, at which time
does Anchorage (ANC, node-id=41) become infected?

\bigskip
\textbf{Ans: }Node 41 is infected at time: 1229290800

\section{Effect of infection probability p on spreading speed}

a)  Plot the averaged prevalence $\rho(t)$ of the disease (fraction of infected nodes) as a
function of time for each of the infection probabilities. Plot the 5 curves in one graph.

b)  For which infection probabilities does the whole network become fully infected?
What are the stepwise, nearly periodic “steps” in the curves due to?

\bigskip
\textbf{Ans: }The probabilies $p=0.5$ and $p=1$ results in the whole network being infected.
The period steps might be due a hub being infected hence, causing a higher dispersal of the infection (hubs have
more neighbours)

\section{Effect of seed node selection on spreading speed}
Next, we will investigate how the selection of the seed node affects the spreading speed.

\bigskip
a) Use nodes with node-ids [0, 4, 41, 100, 200] (ABE, ATL, ACN, HSV, DBQ) as
seeds and p = 0.1, and run the simulation 10 times for each seed node. Then, plot the
average prevalence of the disease separately for each seed node as a function of time.
