# CS-E5740 - Complex Networks, 12.09.2018-12.12.2018 (Aalto University)

______________________________________

Nature is full of networks, from the intracellular machinery inside us to the complex networks of neurons that form our brains, and to the vast number of networks formed by humans, from off- and online social networks to technological systems such as the Internet. 

These networks are important from many points of view - understanding how they work is essential for understanding many natural phenomena, from spreading of diseases to information flows in social networks, and from cascading power grid failures to financial crises.

The Complex Networks course provides you an introduction to the modern theory of networks, together with skills for applying this knowledge to real-world networks and empirical data.

The course consists of lectures and course assignments (= weekly exercises and a project work). There is no exam  - grading is based on points from the course assignments (60% needed for passing the course). Assignments comprise some pen-and-paper maths but mainly computer exercises with Python. Thus, elementary programming skills are required. We'll provide a short Python tutorial and introduce the networkX package used in this course. Solving the exercises requires some time each week, so please plan your studies accordingly.

The course will be lectured by Mikko Kivelä (mikko.kivela@aalto.fi). Course assistants are Tuomas Alakörkkö (tuomas.alakorkko@aalto.fi),  Sara Heydari, Arash Badie Modiri,  Ana Maria Triana Hoyos, Enrico Glerean, Tarmo Nurmi, and Javier Ureña Carrion. The preferred email address for contacting the course staff is cs-e5740@aalto.fi.
