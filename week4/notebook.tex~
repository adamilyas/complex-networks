    \section{1. Percolation in Erdős-Rényi (ER)
networks}\label{percolation-in-erdux151s-ruxe9nyi-er-networks}

Erdős-Rényi networks are random networks where N nodes are randomly
connected such that the probability that a pair of nodes is linked is p.

Sparse ER graph: - average degree \(\langle k \rangle\) is some fixed
small number - the size of the network N is very large. - \$N
\rightarrow \infty, p \rightarrow \infty \$ such that
\(p(N-1) = \langle k \rangle\) stays constant

Percolation properties of ER Graphs.

\emph{percolation threshold} which is the value of \(\langle k \rangle\)
where the giant connected component appears

    \subsubsection{1a)}\label{a}

Using the idea of branching processes and assumption that large and
sparse ER graphs are tree-like,

calculate the expected number of nodes at \(d\) steps away, \(n_d\) ,
from a randomly selected node in an ER network as a function of
\(\langle k \rangle\) and \(d\). Using this result, justify that the
giant component appears in large and sparse ER networks when
\(\langle k \rangle > 1\).

Hints: -- Remember that the degree distribution of an ER network is a
Poisson distribution when \(N \rightarrow \infty\) such that
\(\langle k \rangle\) is constant.

Hence
\(\langle k \rangle = \frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle} - 1\)

    \[\begin{aligned}
n_d & = \langle q \rangle \cdot n_{d-1}\\
& = (\frac{\langle k^2 \rangle}{\langle k \rangle} - 1) \cdot n_{d-1}\\
& = (\frac{\langle k \rangle^2 + \langle k \rangle}{\langle k \rangle} - 1 \cdot n_{d-1}\\
& =  (\langle k \rangle + 1 -1 )\cdot n_{d-1}\\
& =  \langle k \rangle\cdot n_{d-1}
\\\\
n_{d-1} & = \langle k \rangle\cdot n_{d-2}\\
n_{d-2} & = \langle k \rangle\cdot n_{d-3}\\
\vdots &\\\\
n_d & = \langle k \rangle^d
\end{aligned}
\]

We recurse \(d\) times

where \(\langle k \rangle\) is average degree, and \(d\) is the number
of steps

    \subsubsection{1b)}\label{b}

Verify your analytical calculations for \(n_d\) using numerical
simulations. Calculate the \(n_d\) value for \(d \in {0 . . . 15}\),
\(\langle k \rangle \in \{0.5, 1, 2\}\), and starting from enough
randomly selected nodes to get a good estimate for the expected value.
Try out two network sizes: \(N = 10^4\) and \(N = 10^5\) to see how the
size affects the calculations.

    \subsubsection{1c)}\label{c}

Explore the range at which the assumption of tree-likeness of the
network is valid.

This can be done, for example, by calculating the number of edges that
nodes at depth \(d\) have that go back to some earlier level in addition
to the single edge that connects each node to the level \(d − 1\), and

reporting the average fraction of such edges to all edges that go from
depth \(d\) to earlier levels/depths.

In a perfect tree this fraction is exactly 0. Comment on the results,
and their effect on our results to exercise b). What are the other
things that make your analytical calculation of \(n_d\) to differ from
your simulation results?

    \textbf{Ans:}

For average\_degree = 2, for both \(N = 10^4 \text{ and } 10^5\), we
notice from the graph above that we will expect some loops as we go into
more depths.

When loops occur, the average node count will not increase as fast as we
will encounter the same nodes that we counted before and not count them

Thus, the simulated average node count will not increase as fast as in
theory

    \subsubsection{1d)}\label{d}

Calculate the component sizes of simulated ER networks,

and use this data to (loosely) verify that the percolation threshold of
ER networks is at the average degree of \(\langle k \rangle = 1\).

That is, for \(\langle k \rangle < 1\) the largest connected component
is small (size being measured as number of participating nodes), and for
\(\langle k \rangle > 1\) it quickly reaches the network size. Do this
by generating ER networks of size \(N = 10^4\) with different average
degrees: \(\langle k \rangle = [0.00, 0.05, \cdots , 2.45, 2.50]\). For
each of the ER networks, compute the size of the largest component and
plot it against \(\langle k \rangle\)

    \subsubsection{1e)}\label{e}

Another, a more elegant, way to find out when the percolation transition
happens is:

to try to find the point at which the possibility for the largest
component size growth is the largest when the control parameter (here
\(\langle k \rangle\) or \(p\)) is changed very little.

Think about the situation where \(\langle k \rangle\) is changed so
slightly that a single link is added between the largest component and a
randomly selected node that is not in the largest component.

The expected change in the largest component size in this situation is
some times called susceptibility, and it should get very large values at
the percolation transition point. The susceptibility depends on the size
distribution of all the other components, and it can be calculated with
the following formula:

\[χ = \frac{\sum_s s^2 C(s) - s_max^2}{\sum_s s C(s) - s_max^2}\]

where \(C(s)\) is the number of components with \(s\) nodes. Calculate
the susceptibility χ for each network generated in exercise d), and
again plot χ as a function of \(\langle k \rangle\). Explain the shape
of the curve, and its implications.

    Susceptibility is large at the point when the percolation transition
happens

Where making a minor change to the average degree ⟨k⟩ lead to big
changes in the size of largest component (LCC) in the network

\textbf{Observation}

We see in the curve when \(⟨k⟩ \approx 1\), we see a sudden spike in
both graph (by definition, both are dependant to another). As such,
percolation transition happens when average degree \(⟨k⟩ \approx 1\)

    \subsubsection{2 Error and attack tolerance of networks (8
pts)}\label{error-and-attack-tolerance-of-networks-8-pts}

Error and attack tolerance of networks are often characterized using
percolation analysis, where links are removed from the network according
to different rules.

Typically this kind of analyses are performed on infrastructure
networks, such as power-grids or road networks. In this exercise, we
will apply this idea to a Facebook-like web-page , and focus on the role
of strong and weak links in the network.

now to remove links (one by one) from the network in the order of 1.
descending link weight (i.e. remove strong links first), 2. ascending
link weight (i.e. remove weak links first), 3. random order 4.
descending order of edge betweenness centrality (computed for the full
network at the beginning).

While removing the links, monitor the size of the largest component S as
a function of the fraction of removed links \(f \n [0, 1]\)

    \subsubsection{2a)}\label{a}

Visualize \(S\) as a function of \(f\) in all four cases in one plot.
There should be clear differences between all four curves.

    \subsubsection{2b)}\label{b}

For which of the four approaches is the network most and least
vulnerable? In other words, in which case does the giant component
shrink fastest / slowest? Or is this even simple to define?

    \paragraph{Most vulnerable}\label{most-vulnerable}

\textbf{Descending order of edge betweenness centrality} Centrality
measures how important an edge is. How important meaning that this edge
acts as a link between clusters of nodes and by removing this edge, the
probability of breaking up a to 2 components is hight

\paragraph{Least vulnerable}\label{least-vulnerable}

\textbf{descending link weight (i.e. remove strong links first)}

    \subsubsection{2c)}\label{c}

When comparing the removal of links in \textbf{ascending} and
\textbf{descending} order strong and weak links first, which ones are
more important for the integrity of the network? Why do you think this
would be the case?

    \textbf{Ans}

The weaker links are more important for the integrity.

Removal of a weak link leads to a higher chance of severing a connection
to a hub, Thus, multiple nodes that are dependant on the link will not
be able to get to the node easily

    \subsubsection{2d)}\label{d}

How would you explain the difference between the random removal strategy
and the removal in descending order of edge betweenness strategy?
