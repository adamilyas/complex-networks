\section{Implementing the Barab치si-Albert (BA) model}

The Barab치si-Albert scale-free network model is a model of network growth, where new nodes
continuously enter the network and make links to existing nodes with a probability that is
linearly proportional to their degree. The steps required for generating a Barab치si-Albert scale-
free network with N nodes are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item Create a small seed network which has at least m nodes, where m is the number of links a
  new node creates to already existing nodes. \textit{For the propose of this exercise, use 3-clique as the seed network.}
\item Add new nodes to the network until your network has $N$ nodes, such that each entering node has $m$ links and connects to existing nodes proportional to their degrees.
\item[a) ]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[--] \textbf{Implement} a Python function for generating Barab치si-Albert networks. Then generate a network with $N = 200$ and $m = 1$ (a tree!).
    \item[--] \textit{Write} down degree of the node with the highest degree in your generated network.
    \item[--] \textit{Write} down total number of links in your generated network.
    \item[--] \textbf{visualize} it with networkx using the spring layout i.e. \texttt{nx.draw\_spring(G)}. You should be able to spot some nodes that have many connections, while most of the
nodes have few connections.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
